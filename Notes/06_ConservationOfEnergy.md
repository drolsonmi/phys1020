## Law of Conservation of Energy
Two ways that energy can be added to a system:
- Doing work (moving an object)
- Adding heat to it

$$W + Q = \Delta (KE + PE + TE)$$

We often like to consider a system where no heat or work is applied:

$$W + Q = 0$$

When this happens, there will be no change in total energy:

$$\begin{align*}0 &= \Delta (KE + PE) \\ 0 &= KE_f + PE_f - KE_0 - PE_0 \\ KE_0 + PE_0 &= KE_f + PE_f \\ E_{\text{in}} &= E_{\text{out}}\end{align*}$$

The total amount of energy remains the same.

> $$PE = mgh = 0.050~kg \times 9.8 \tfrac{m}{s^2} \times (0)=0~J$$
> * Where did the energy go?
> $$\begin{align*}KE_0 + PE_0 &= KE_f + PE_f \\ 0 + mgh &= KE_f + 0 \\ 0.3675~J = KE_f\end{align*}$$
> * At the other side of the swing, it goes to a height of 75 cm and stops. How much PE does it have? How much KE does it have?
> $$PE_f = mgh_f = 0.050~kg \times 9.8 \tfrac{m}{s^2} \times 0.75~m = 0.3675~J$$
> $$\begin{align*}KE_0 + PE_0 &= KE_f + PE_f \\ 0 + 0.3675~J &= KE_f + 0.36775~J \\ 0 = KE_f\end{align*}$$

## Energy Conversion Efficiencies

**Demo:** Rubber ball

Sometimes energy is not fully converted into a single type. A rubber ball does not bounce as high as the height it was dropped from.

- Work done by the floor squishes the ball and reintroduces thermal energy (TE)

Efficiency measures how much energy is conserved in a conversion process:

\[
\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Energy output}}{\text{Energy input}} \times 100\%
\]

For a bouncing ball:

\[
\text{Output} = PE_f
\]

\[
\text{Input} = PE_i
\]

Sometimes we take advantage of energy losses to do work—for example, generating electricity. A fuel releases energy, and part of that energy is converted into useful work. It is impossible to recover 100% of the energy, so efficiency tells us how much we recover.
